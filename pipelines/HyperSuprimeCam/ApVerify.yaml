# Gen 3 pipeline for ap_verify
# This concatenates various lsst.verify metrics to an AP pipeline

description: Fully instrumented AP pipeline specialized for HSC
imports:
  - location: $AP_VERIFY_DIR/pipelines/ApVerify.yaml
    # Include all metrics from standard pipeline. It's not practical to create
    # a metrics subset because it would require constant micromanagement.
    exclude:
      - apPipe
  - location: $AP_PIPE_DIR/pipelines/HyperSuprimeCam/ApPipe.yaml
tasks:
  # ApVerify override removed by excluding apPipe.
  diaPipe:
    class: lsst.ap.association.DiaPipelineTask
    config:
      doPackageAlerts: True
contracts:
  # Must re-declare contracts that cross apPipe and metrics boundary, as
  # these were removed on import.

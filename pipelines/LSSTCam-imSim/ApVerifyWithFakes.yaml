  # The existing Fakes insertion system is not currently compatible with the
  # new CalibrateImageTask, so the fakes pipeline still is on the old tasks.

  # Can't use $AP_PIPE_DIR/pipelines/LSSTCam-imSim/ApPipeWithFakes.yaml here
  # because the changes made by that file and _ingredients/ApVerifyWithFakes.yaml
  # are hard to separate.
